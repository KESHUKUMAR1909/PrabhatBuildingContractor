## 🧠 Reflection Questions

### a. What was the most challenging part for you?
The most challenging part was designing a fully responsive layout and implementing smooth scroll-based animations that worked seamlessly across devices. Also, getting the hover effects and section highlights right with only HTML, CSS, and JS was a bit tricky without using any frameworks.

### b. How did you solve it?
I used a combination of resources including:
- 🔍 **ChatGPT** (Ready.AI) for layout structure ideas, color palette, and scroll animation guidance
- 📺 **YouTube** tutorials for responsive design techniques and CSS transitions
- 📚 **MDN Web Docs** for CSS properties and validation tips

### c. What did you learn during this task?
- How to build a real estate-style landing page using **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**
- Better understanding of **flexbox** and **media queries**
- How to design for both **desktop and mobile views**
- Importance of **user experience** and visual hierarchy in web design

### d. If we ask you to improve it tomorrow, what would you add?
- Add **dynamic property filtering** using JavaScript
- Integrate **Google Maps** to show location
- Use **localStorage** to toggle and persist **dark/light mode**
- Add **testimonials** section with carousel
- Connect **backend form handling** using Node.js or a service like Formspree

### e. What is your goal for the next 3 months if selected?
- Master **full stack development** with MERN
- Contribute to **live projects** and strengthen deployment skills
- Learn **API integration**, **authentication systems**, and **state management**
